# Yootheme Pro Spacer Element

This is a simple Spacer element for the YOOtheme Pro page builder.

## Quick Installation

The Spacer element can be added using a child-theme or a Joomla or WordPress plugin. The easiest way to quickly try it out is by using a child theme. 

1. Create and activate a child theme in [Joomla](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/developers-child-themes#create-a-child-theme) or [WordPress](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/wordpress/developers-child-themes#create-a-child-theme) for YOOtheme Pro.
2. [Download](https://github.com/yootheme/example-element/archive/master.zip) and unzip the example element.
3. Create a `builder` directory in the child theme and copy the `yoo_spacer` directory into it.
4. Open YOOtheme Pro and the *Spacer Element* is available in the element library.
